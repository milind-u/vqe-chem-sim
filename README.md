## Molecule simulation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver

Website is live at https://vqechemsim.streamlit.app/

Web app to simulate a few different molecules, computing their ideal atomic bonding distances using Variational Quantum Eigensolver and then displaying these results.

- `vqe.py`: VQE and molecule simulation code
- `streamlit_app.py`: Website UI code

# Simulation results
Note that distances are simulated in increments of .05 angstrom.
